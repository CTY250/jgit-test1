Read the title, I'm screaming
Are you screaming?
Yes I am screaming, read the title please
Oh nice, how's your throat?
My throat has never been worse, can I get a cup of water?
Sure
Thanks
So are you going to scream more?
Yes
Ok maybe you should stop
But the title of this text file is mandating me to scream. I have to scream, it's my lifeblood
